# ConvNeXt-MHC
readme
Peptide binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins plays a critical role in T-cell recognition and the specificity of the immune response. As a result, accurate prediction of binding peptides is highly important, particularly in the context of cancer immunotherapy applications. There is a significant need to continually improve the existing prediction methods to meet the demands of this field. We developed ConvNeXt-MHC, an MHC class I predictive model that introduces a degenerate encoding approach to enhance well-established panspecific methods and integrates transfer learning and semi-supervised learning methods into the cutting-edge deep learning framework ConvNeXt. Comprehensive benchmark results demonstrate that ConvNeXt-MHC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. We expect that ConvNeXt-MHC will help us foster new discoveries in the field of immunoinformatics in the distant future.
Availability: We constructed a user-friendly website at http://www.combio-lezhang.online/predict/, where users can access our data and application. The source code and data for our proposed method can be found at https://github.com/goldwaterkk/ConvNeXt-MHC.git.
